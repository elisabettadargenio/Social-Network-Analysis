# Social-Network-Analysis
Starting from the data collected on the signing of legal acts by the deputies of the Chamber in the last legislature, and from the personal information concerning the parliamentarians themselves, a social network was built, i.e. a structure characterized by nodes (individuals) and arcs (the relationships between individuals).
The initial adjacency matrix was then transformed into an indirect and unweighted network.

Data are available in Political_Network_ITA.Rdata workspace
